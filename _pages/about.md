My name is Olivier Cornes. I am an aerospace engineer and an expert in computational design.
After researching logistic-based design optimization algorithms for NASA at [MIT's engineering systems Laboratory](https://systems.mit.edu/),
I joined [Aurora Flight Science's](https://www.aurora.aero/) as a conceptual aircraft designer for commercial electric vertical lift (eVTOL) projects.
Since then, my interest has focused on researching computational design methods for safety-critical systems.
Currently, I am a combat aircraft systems engineer at the [Swiss Airforce's industrial arm](https://www.ruag.ch/en/our-competencies/life-cycle-management/air-systems/professional-life-cycle-management-fighter-jets-and-guided-missiles),
working on projects related to safety-critical avionics and military aircraft certification.

Recently, my research has been focused on applying Natural Language Processing to computational design of safety-critical systems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
